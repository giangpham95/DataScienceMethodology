## Cross Industry Process for Data Minining (CRISP-DM) methodology

### What is CRISP-DM?

The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business applications and industries.

The intent is to take case specific scenarios and general behaviors to make them domain neutral.

CRISP-DM is compromised of six steps with an entity that has to implement in order to have a reasonable chance of success:

+ **Business Understanding**
  + Most important b/c where the intention of project is outlined
  + Require communication and clarity
  + Difficult here is that stakeholders have different objectives, biases and modalities of relating information.
+ **Data Understanding**
  + Collect data based on the understand of business requirement
  + Combine Data Requirements, Data Collection, and Data Understanding from the Foundational Methodology
+ **Data Preparation**
  + Transform the collected data into subset unless it is determined that more data is needed.
  + Check for questionable, missing, or ambigous cases
+ **Modeling**
  + Express data in the appropriate models, give meaningful insights and hopefully new knowledge.
  + Models are selected on portion of data and adjustments are made if necessary.
+ **Evaluation**
  + Test the selected model to determine efficacy of the model and foreshadows its role in the next and final stage.
+ **Deployment**
  + The model is used on the new dataset outside the scope of dataset and by new stakeholders.

CRISP-Dm is highly flexible and cyclical model.
